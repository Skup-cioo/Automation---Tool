Welcome to Selenium-RestAssured-Java, a simple tool for testing!

This repository houses GUI tests for websites like [Selenium08 Blog](https://selenium08.blogspot.com) and [Try Testing This](https://trytestingthis.netlify.app/), offering straightforward tasks to enhance your automation skills. Additionally, you'll find API tests written in RestAssured, utilizing APIs such as [Simple Grocery Store API](https://github.com/vdespa/Postman-Complete-Guide-API-Testing/blob/main/simple-grocery-store-api.md#Status) and [Reqres API](https://reqres.in/).
